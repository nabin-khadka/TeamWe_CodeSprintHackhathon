# Demand Loading Debug Guide

## Issue: Sellers cannot load demands posted by buyers

### Debugging Steps Added:

1. **Enhanced API Error Handling**: Added detailed console logging in `demandAPI.getDemands()` to track:
   - Request URL and parameters
   - Authentication token status
   - Response status and data
   - Specific error types (network, server, auth)

2. **Frontend Response Handling**: Updated `view-demands.tsx` to handle different response formats:
   - Direct array response
   - Nested `response.demands` array
   - Nested `response.data` array

3. **API Connectivity Test**: Added test function to check:
   - Backend server health endpoint
   - Authentication token availability
   - Network connectivity

4. **Enhanced UI Feedback**: Added refresh button and API test button when no demands are found

### Potential Root Causes:

1. **Backend Server Not Running**: 
   - The backend server might not be running on the expected port
   - Use "Test API" button to verify server connectivity

2. **Database Empty**: 
   - No demands have been successfully created in the database
   - Check if buyer demand creation is actually saving to DB

3. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Seller token might be invalid or expired
   - Token format might not match backend expectations

4. **Network Configuration**:
   - API_URL might be pointing to wrong endpoint
   - CORS issues between frontend and backend

5. **Data Format Mismatch**:
   - Backend might be returning data in unexpected format
   - Frontend expecting array but getting object

### Next Steps:

1. Run the app and check "Test API" button to verify connectivity
2. Check browser/console logs for detailed error messages
3. Verify backend server is running on correct port
4. Test demand creation from buyer side to ensure data is being saved
5. Check database directly to see if demands exist

### Quick Fixes Applied:

- Added comprehensive error logging
- Added fallback data format handling
- Added manual refresh capability
- Added API connectivity test
- Enhanced error messages with specific guidance

The debugging tools should now provide clear information about where the issue lies.
